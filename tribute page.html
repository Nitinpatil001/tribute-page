        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>(Shivaji Bhonsle: 19 February 1630 - 3 April 1680), also referred to as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian ruler and
            a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan. Eventually, Shivaji carved out his own independent
            kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which formed the genesis of the
            Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.</p>
